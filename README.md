#### I'll be working along with the class to create a repository for reference and collaboration, as well as to help me maintain perspective so that I can be a better mentor.

  * Select "Do Not Use Top Level Statements".  This creates a more explicit program syntax, which is more complete for learning purposes.  You are going to want to learn how to deal with both namespaces and classes, so now is as good a time as any to start using them.
    ```
    namespace Week_240616
    {
        internal class Program
        {
            static void Main(string[] args)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
            }
        }
    }
    ```
  * If you just want to jump straight into code quickly, you can use the top level statements for really simple quick code.  However, 9 out of 10 times once you get past 'simple quick script' you'll end up going back and having to deal with namespaces, classes, etc.  Below is the same code using the simplified top level statements format.
    ```
    Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
    ```
  * It's quick and fast, but it's not as complete as the first example.  It's a good way to get started, but you'll want to learn the more complete syntax as soon as possible.
